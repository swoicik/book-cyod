# 3.X - Include Students 

## One Sentence 

## Notes
Students are 80% to 85% of your districts population. They should be included in the process. Their feedback and perspective is incredibly powerful. Talk with them, send out surveys, observe how they use the technology. 

In an earlier section, we talked about 1:1 is for everyone. The goes beyond just the device. You work with techers and administrators to get them the tools they needs. The hardware they are comfortabe, the software that helps them get the job done. Why isn't the same done with students?

It can be as simple as sending out a survey. Get a better understanding of what the students view the device as and how they use it. 

Some example survey questions:

Do you have a computer in your home? What kinds?

Do you have internet access at home?

What software do you use the most for school work?

What can't you do with your school computer now that you want to?

What software or app do you want to use in school but can't?

You'll get some requests for the lastest game or a video website, but you'll also get a lot of honest feedback. 

From experience, most of the changes I have made to our systems, policies, and purhcasing have been from student requests. They are using this technology every day for the purpose we want it used for. We'd be crazy not to listen to 85% of our user base. 

In any other snearior, ignoring 85% of your user base would be insane. But in education, it'f often the case.
