Money will always be tight in education. Thatâ€™s the nature of dealing with such a large and diverse population. There is always a need for more resources but a limited pool of funding. And everyone wants the best for their kids. 

The funding may change but you need to keep the program running. Consistency is key to building a great 1:1 program and consistency requires lots of resourcefulness to keep it going. 

This need to be engrained in the culture of the school. Teachers, students, administrators, any staff needs to have this mindset of being resourceful to keep the program running and effective. 

You'd be amazed how much stuff shoe strings can hold up with everyone contributes. 

You can always go back when funding is available and create better fixes or permanent solutions. But going through the shoestring and resourcefulness phase will give you a better understanding of what is truly needed and how your population uses it. You can come to the table with a practical knowledge.
