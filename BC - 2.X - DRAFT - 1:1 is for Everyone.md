# 1:1 Is For Everybody 

## One Sentence

## Notes
Teachers, administrators, and staff should be part of the 1:1 program. A platform for everyone. The same resources the students use are the resources the teacher use, are the resources the administrators use, are the resources the tech department uses. 

Include everyone in the 1-1 program, don’t single out students. It never makes sense to me in a school district, when teachers, students, and admins all run on their own system. Teachers have Mac Computers, Students have Chromebooks, and Admins have Windows. Students don’t deserve an inferior device. Let them be able to do the same thing as the teachers.

A 1: 1 program isn't just for students. It's beneficial and logical to have it apply to everyone. Teachers, administrators, and staff should all be part of the 1:1. 

This will greatly simplify the strain on the IT department from a management perspective. No need to treat students and staff different when it comes to technology hardware.

It also solves refresh problems. Teachers can be on the same 4 or 5 year refresh cycle as students. It makes budgeting and planning for the future much easier. 

And since you are using a CYOD program, teachers and staff still get a choice of which device fits them best.
