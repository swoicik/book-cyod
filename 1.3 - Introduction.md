# 3 Stories that prompted the writing of this book. 

## Story 1: My Son
The first experience that prompted me to begin seriously researching the idea of a CYOD or multi-device program for education was my son. 

He has grown up in a time that has computers always accessible and the internet always on. Thanks to cellular data speeds, the terms “offline” or “no internet” don’t come up often. He has always had computers available to him (desktops, laptops, iPads, smartphones, and even a smart tv), but he doesn’t see any of these devices as computers. He doesn’t even really understand what a phone is. These devices are all just gateways to the internet. 

He knows any of these devices will get him to his favorite YouTube Kids shows or allow him to watch Mickey Mouse on a long car ride. The medium in which he gets to the content is irrelevant and don’t even enter his thinking. 

This is far different from how things were when I was first exposed to technology. The internet wasn’t ever present and content wasn’t platform agnostics. To okay certain games you needed Windows. To use certain programs you needed a Mac. Even the way you accessed the internet was based on the device you had. And there was no guarantee everything would be accessible through the device you chose. The screen may be to small, the OS too old, the graphics card not powerful enough.

These problems are almost nonexistent now. And becoming less and less a concern, if at all, to students in school now. Every device has a touch screen, every device access the internet, and any piece of content can be viewed on the device. 

The device no longer matters. It is only a way to access the internet. 

## Story 2: Standardized Testing 
Standardized testing is ever present in education. Regardless if you think it’s good or bad for students, it’s become a way of life in education. 

Students across the country in almost all grade levels take some for of standardized test. 

This sometimes is done with pen and paper or a scantron sheet, but more and more it’s done on a computer. And that computer is often the same for everyone. If you are doing testing on a Chromebook, every student in the school is using a Chromebook. If it’s Windows, every student is using Windows. Every student is on the same platform, taking the same test, with the same resources. 

I was put in the position of starting a new job a couple months before standardized testing on computers was about the start. The school district had made the choice that all students would use chromebooks (standard 11.6 non touch screens with a keyboard). The problem, there wasn’t enough Chromebooks for testing. I had to order more computers. 

The Chromebooks that were already in district were older and not worth buying more off. I chose a new model that had a touchscreen and was capable of being used as a tablet (the 4 in 1 laptop style). 

My thought process being, the Chromebooks could be used the same as the existing Chromebooks fro testing, and after testing we could experiment with the touch and tablet aspects of the device. It was getting what we needed in the moment and planning for the future. 

As testing got started, I made the rounds to classrooms. Checking that testing was running smoothly and troubleshooting when necessary. As I made the rounds I saw how students were using the new Chromebooks. 

Students with the new Chromebooks chose to use the devices in a way that was most comfortable to them. Some used them as regular laptops. Some had an external mouse attached. Some preferred to use the keyboard and touch screen to navigate. Some skipped the physical keyboard all together and preferred to use the touch screen keyboard.

The devices capable is the 4 in 1 layout option were used in a variety of ways. The student chose what was most comfortable for them to take the test.

too much good educational dollars go towards bad technology implementation.
