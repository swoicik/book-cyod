# It Doesn't Have to Scale

## One Sentence 

## Notes
The switch is diffucelt at the start and there are growing pains, as with any new program. My advice is to focus less on the preccesses at the start. Not every system needs to scale or be automatted from the start. 

Scale is great when done properly. It lets you take a process and extrapilate it and possible automat it so your team can be better work with a bigger impact. 

But scale are the roll out phase is dangerous. It can make you compromise, and it's diffuctly to scale down if you've made a mistake. 

Go back to the basics with your IT support. Track devices as they are returned, track repairs you make, track who has what. This can be done on paper or just an excel spreadsheet. 

Get a better idea of what devices get what types of damage, and why kind of support your users need before scaling up.

While on the topic of simplifyng the IT logisticts. Let's talk about all these new processes you need to have to support a CYOD program. 

This argument usually comes up when I mention a roll out of a CYOD program to distrcit Technology Directors. 

"It's great in theory to do this, but the logisitics won't work. We would need more people to manage everything." or "My school is too big to do something like this."

It's a fair argument and I completley understand the appeal of everyone havig the same device. It makes live a lot easier. Troublehsooting is all the same. Repairs are all the same. It's very easy to have a assembly line kind of support model with each support ticket that comes in. 

CYOD throw most of this out the windows. But the goal isn't to make IT easier, it's to make the students educaion easier and more impactful.
