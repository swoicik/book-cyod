# 2.1 - What Is 1:1

## One Sentence
A brief introduction to what 1:1 implementations exist today. 

## Notes
Let's start with where we are now in educational technology. What 1:1 implementation are currently being used in Kindergarten through 12th grade schools (K12).

The technology model in education has been static for some time. There are a few main models used. 

1. BYOD - Students are encouraged to bring their own devices to use in school. This saves the district money by not having to buy a device for every students. It is also very quick way to implement and scale. The district can go from no devices to a 1:1 program practically over night. The downside is you have to support a wide variety of devices, and the technology equality gap can be very wide depending on your district. A student using a lasted model MacBook Pro and a student using a Kindle Fire will have very different experiences and abilities with the device.  

2. Single Device - This is the most widely used 1:1 implementation. This program gives every student in the grade/school/district the same device. This model has been around for as long as there has been personal computers small enough to travel with a students. Laptops, iPads, Chromebooks, Netbooks, Kindles have all been used in 1:1 programs. It creates a uniform platform for everyone to work from. It also locks the district and the student into a single platform. This makes managements much easier from the IT perspective. It gives a consistent budget. And it gives an equal technology experience to all students. 

3. Computer Lab or computer area model. This setup provides a group of computers in a lab or classroom settings. This was popular with completely stationary desktops, less popular with mobile devices and laptops. 

4. Cart computing. As mobile devices became more popular and accessible in education, cart computing began to replace lab set ups. You would have a cart with 20-30 devices and that cart would be shared by the grade/school. A teacher would sign out a cart to use for a class period and have 1:1 for a specific project or task. 

## Content
1:1 is not a new or unique idea. It’s not even a result of educational technology. Before we had computers small enough for every student to carry one, we had textbooks that every student carried. The idea being that every student has their own educational material. Wether that is paper or electronic. 

But this book is about technology, so let’s start with where we are now in educational technology. What 1:1 implementation are currently being used in Kindergarten through 12th grade schools (K12).

The technology model in education has been static for some time. We are at the point now where schools and communities are asking what’s next for 1:1. What’s the next innovation. 

There are a few main models used. 

**Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** - Students are encouraged to bring their own devices to use in school. This saves the district money by not having to buy a device for every students. It is also a very quick way to implement and scale. The district can go from no devices to a 1:1 program practically over night. The downside is you have to support a wide variety of devices, and the technology equality gap can be very wide depending on your district. A student using a lasted model MacBook Pro and a student using a two year old Kindle Fire will have very different experiences and abilities with the device.  

**Single Device** - This is the most widely used 1:1 implementation, in my experience. This program gives every student in the grade/school/district the same device. This model has been around for as long as there has been personal computers small enough to travel with a students. Some argue it has been around even longer. Before we had ipads we called them textbooks and gave every student one. Laptops, iPads, Chromebooks, Netbooks, Kindles have all been used in 1:1 programs. It creates a uniform platform for everyone to work from. It also locks the district and the student into a single platform. This makes managements much easier from the IT perspective. It gives a consistent budget. And it gives an equal technology experience to all students. 

**Computer Lab** - This setup provides a group of computers in a lab or classroom settings. This was popular with completely stationary desktops, less popular with mobile devices and laptops.

**Cart computing** - As mobile devices became more popular and accessible in education, cart computing began to replace lab set ups. You would have a cart with 20-30 devices and that cart would be shared by the grade/school. A teacher would sign out a cart to use for a class period and have 1:1 for a specific project or task. 

Most districts will have some combination of these methods. Your district might have a 1:1 program that consists of Single Device at the high schools, carts in lower grade, and a computer lab or two mixed in (often in the library). 

There is no one way or perfect way to have a 1:1 program. The whole idea of the program is giving student access to the best resources to make them successful in their education. Use what you have and make it work.
