# CYOD (Choose Your Own Device)
This repository is a being used for writing my first book on educational technology. Specifically the use of a CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) program in a K12 environment. 

I am writing this book entirely in public. You can view the progress, changes, and half formed thought here. You can even see the changed over time in the version history. 

To find our more about the project and learn how to support it, visit the public GitHub page at https://swoicik.github.io/cyod.
