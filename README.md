# CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) Reserch Branch
This repository is a being used for collecting notes and research for my first book on educational technology. Specifically the use of a CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) program in a K12 environment. 

The book is being written entirely in public. You can view the progress, changes, and half formed thoughts on the master branch. You can see the changes over time in the version history.

To learn more about the project and how to support it, visit the public GitHub page at https://cyod.xyz.
