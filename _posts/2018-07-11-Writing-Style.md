What will the writing style of the book be? 

After writing down all the random notes, ideas, and research I had for this book, I needed to find a way to organize it all. I looked at other education and non-fiction books that I had read and enjoyed. Looking at the structure and organization of the books, I tried to find a good fit for this book.

Two of my favorite non-fiction books are [REWORK](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) and [REMOTE](https://basecamp.com/books/remote). Both books by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com). The books are not just full of good content, but the content is presented in a very understandable way. 

Thes books are great information broken up into short chapters/sections that fit into 3-4 main categories. This format makes the book's information easy to digest and remember. It also makes it easy to refer back to content you like. When I want to revisit an idea I like in one of the books, I can just reread the entire chapter (only a few paragraphs usually). I don't have to hunt through pages of content to find the one paragraph that had the information I want.
