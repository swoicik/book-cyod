What will the writing style and format of the book be? 

After I started writing down all the random notes, ideas, and research I had for this book, I needed to find a way to organize it all. I looked at other education and non-fiction books that are popular or that I had read. I looked at their book stucutre to try and find a good fit for this book. 

Two of my favorite non-fiction books are (REWORK)[https://basecamp.com/books/rework] and (REMOTE)[https://basecamp.com/books/remote]. Both books by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of (Basecamp)[https://basecamp.com]. These books are full of good information broken up into short chapters/sections that fit into 3-4 main categories. This format make the book's information easy to digest and remember. It also makes it easy to refer back to content you like.
