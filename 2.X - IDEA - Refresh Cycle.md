# Refresh Cycle

## Notes
Hardware refresh and software refresh (OS and Management) 

Figure out a refresh cycle that is manageable for your district. 

Too often these refresh cycles are done by building g a 10 year plan. These seem to almost never work. Figure out a plan based on refresh cycles and you have a plan that will be sustainable for a lot more than 10 years.

Once everyone is in your 1:1 program and any device will work, its time to consider refresh cycle. 

In the typical or conventional way things are done is you create a 10 year plan. It's usually a long formal document that lays how when you want to buy computers, add computers, refresh equipment, and how this will impact learning. 

It takes a long time to do and is rarely followed up on. It's almost impossible to create an accurate 10 year plan. There are too many variables. 

- You don't have a guaranteed budget (you rely on taxes, the town, and the school committee to set you budget. You also have to hope there isn't unforeseen expenses or people in other departments over spending and draining the pot) 
- The cost of technology changes constantly (that great deal you got on windows desktops last year, isn't available this year) 
- The types of technology change. When you started your plan Windows was the way to go. Now your district wants to flip to Apple because the school committee thinks their the best. You bought all HP products because they were the right price. HP got bought out by IBM and they no longer make desktops. Amazon entered the education market with a device you just can't pass up, but wasn't anywhere in your ten year plan. 

All these situation and variables may seem far fetched, but I've seen them all happen.
