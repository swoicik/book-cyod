Some guidelines to follow when choosing software to use in your classroom or technology programs. 

1. Must be student accessible. If the software or tool is not accessible to both the teacher and the student, it's not a good fit. Some examples; SMART Notebook, a tool that is only accessible to the teacher, but can't be shared with students outside of the classroom. Microsoft Work, if the students don't also have access to Microsoft Office, dont' share Word documents with them. Use what the students have access too. If it can't be used outside fo the classroom, it shouldn't be used. 

2. Think about offline access. Not every software you choose for your classroom needs to have an offline component, but it help. Not all students will have 24/7 internet access or even power access outside of the classroom. Take into account your student population and needs outside of the classroom. If part of a project can't be done offline, assign that as the homework part. If students need to work on things outside of the classroom, teach them how to download things at school to work on later. 

3. Accessibility matters.
