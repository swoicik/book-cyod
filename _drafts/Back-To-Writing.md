I took the month of August off from writing and working on this book. It was good to take a vacation. 

I am now back to writing with some fresh perspective and better thought out ideas after having time to just let them sit. I will be updating the GitHub repository more often with new research notes and a few added chapters to the outline. 

Keep checking back for more updates.
