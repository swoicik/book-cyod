The equity vs equality debate is all over education. Depending on your definition and interpretation, the debate will mean different things to you. Here is what I am presenting for this book. 

Equality is giving every student the same device. I.e every students gets a Chromebook. Some students may have a Chromebook at home and know how to use it really well. Some students may have an iPad at home and have no idea how to use a Chromebook. All the kids were treated equal by receiving the same technology, but their skills with the technology will have a big disparity. The end result won't be equal. 

Equity is giving every student a device they are comfortable with use. If a student wants a Chromebook, they can use a Chromebook. If they like the iPad, use an iPad. If their parents are open source developers and taught the student to use Linux, let the student use Linux. Their skills and production with the device they know will make the end result equal. 

Equality is giving everyone the same thing. Equity is giving everyone what they need to succeed. 

Choice in technology is about equity. It's about giving every student the best device for them.
