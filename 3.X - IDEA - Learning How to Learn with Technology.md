# 3.X - Learning How To Learn

## One Sentence

## Notes
Once a student is in high school, most have figured out their learning style. They know what works best for them. If you want technology to take off in your school you need to start young. 

I don’t mean roll out a 1-1 program in grades PreK-5 first, but make sure these grades have access to technology. Students can’ have limited technology use in school, then be given a laptop when they get to high school and be expected to know what to do with it. They will treat it like they do a personal device, because that is all they have had. And oftentimes, they will prefer to use their personal device.

Students need to learn how to learn with technology in younger grades. This doesn’ need to be taken to an extreme. I’m not recommending out K-4th graders should be on computers all day, but they should know about computers and have experience using them as a educational tool. Not just for games and videos like they may do at home.
