# What Is CYOD

CYOD stands for Choose Your Own Device. The acronym is a play on BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), that has long been a standard in education. 

The technology model in education has been pretty static for a long time. There were only a few models used. 

1. BYOD - students were encouraged to bring their own devices to school to use. This saved the distrcit money, but not having to buy a device for every students. It is also very quick to implement and scale. The downside is you have to support a wide variety of devices, and the technology equality gap can be very wide depedning on your district. 

2. A tranditional 1:1 program gives every student in a grade/school/district the same device. This model has been around for as long as there has been personal computers small enough to travel with a students. Laptops, iPads, Chromebooks, Netbooks, have all been used in 1:1 programs. It creates a uniform platform for everyone to work from. It also locks the district in to a single platform.
