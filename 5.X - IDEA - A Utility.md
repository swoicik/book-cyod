Technology is now a utility. Technology should be seen by staff, administrators, school committees, the community and anyone else that has a say in public schools, as a utility. It's a necessity in schools now, not a nice to have. It should be funded the same way you pay for for electric, heat, and water. It is a necessity to having a school.
