## Notes
Going 1-1 isn’t an overnight success. It will take multiple school years to get it right and get everyone really using it. It’s a big change for everyone. Student included. It’s a new way to learn for them, and for the older students it’s a big change. They have already figured out how they want to learn. It will take a few years for a generation of younger students to have been using the devices for extended time, and learned how to learn with the devices. 

Go Green. 1-1 programs are a great way to push for a reduction or removal of printing. When everyone has a screen in front of them, they shouldn’t need to print out worksheets.

### Anywhere Not Everywhere

### Sunk Cost Bias

### Endowment Effect
Wikipedia Example: This is typically illustrated in two ways.[3] In a valuation paradigm, people will tend to pay more to retain something they own than to obtain something they do not own--even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a Swiss chocolate bar were generally unwilling to trade it for a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling to trade it for the chocolate bar. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect 

### Status Quo Bias
Wikipedia Definition: Status quo bias is an emotional bias; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss. Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the status quo ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.

## Quotes
"It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage a revolution and found this nation. Students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Google, Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other." - Barack Obama - https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obamas-back-school-message-students/story?id=8509426

"There can be infinite uses of the computer and of new age technology, but if teachers themselves are not able to bring it into the classroom and make it work, then it fails." - Nancy Kassebaum

"New technology is common, new thinking is rare." - Sir Peter Blake - https://sirpeterblaketrust.org/home

"Teaching in the Internet age means we must teach tomorrow’s skills today." - Jennifer Fleming

Teachers need to integrate technology seamlessly into the curriculum instead of viewing it as an add-on, an afterthought, or an event. - Heidi-Hayes Jacobs - http://www.curriculum21.com

"We need technology in every classroom and in every student and teacher’s hand, because it is the pen and paper of our time, and it is the lens through which we experience much of our world." – David Warlick - http://2cents.onlearning.us

Technology is anything that wasn’t around when you were born. - Alan Kay - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay

We need to prepare students for their future, not our past. - Ian Jukes

Since we live in an age of innovation, a practical education must prepare a man for work that does not yet exist and cannot yet be clearly defined. - Peter F. Drucker - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker

The world we have created is a product of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking. - Albert Einstein - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein
