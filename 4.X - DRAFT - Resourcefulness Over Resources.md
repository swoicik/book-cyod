# Resourcefulness Over Resources

## One Sentence

## Notes
Money will always be tight in education. That’s the nature of dealing with such a large and diverse population. There is always a need for more resources but a limited pool of funding. And everyone wants the best for their kids.

The funding may change but you need to keep the program running. Consistency is key to building a great 1:1 program and consistency requires lots of resourcefulness to keep it going.

This need to be engrained in the culture of the school. Teachers, students, administrators, any staff needs to have this mindset of being resourceful to keep the program running and effective.

You'd be amazed how much stuff shoe strings can hold up with everyone contributes.

You can always go back when funding is available and create better fixes or permanent solutions. But going through the shoestring and resourcefulness phase will give you a better understanding of what is truly needed and how your population uses it. You can come to the table with a practical knowledge.

Money will always be a limiting factor in education. Working within a budget is a common constraint. For better or worse that is how it is (and education isn’t alone in this constraint). 

There will always be a need or a want for more resources, more money, better systems, etc. Everyone wants the best for their students. To be successful in the long term you need to learn how to work within these contrainsts. 

Embrace the idea of resourcefulness over resources. This is a motto that needs to be engrained in the culture of your district, school, classroom, staff, and students. A focus on doing the best work with what is available and not what you wish you have. Make it work with what is possible, rather than dreaming of what if. 

You’ll be amazed what can be accomplished with what you arelady have, and how creative your staff, students, and community are. Shoe strings can hold up an incredible amount when everyone works together. 

There is always the opportunity to go back when funding is available and create better fixes or permanent solutions. But going through the shoestring and resourcefulness phase will give you a better understanding of what is truly needed and how your population uses it. Come to the budgeting table with a practical knowledge and be better or in the long run for it. 

Know the real problem before throwing money and resources at it. Resourcefulness.
