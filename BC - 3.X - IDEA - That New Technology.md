# 3.X - That New Technology

## One Sentence 

## Notes
I’ve heard it before from teachers, staff, and parents. The students are using so much new technology it’s impossible to keep up. 

The technology the students are using is technology usually invented by the parents generation. The 5th graders using the latest social networking app was created by the generation before. 

Don’t shift blame to students for using technology that the previous generation gave them.
