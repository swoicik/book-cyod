# 3.X - Digital Native

## One Sentence

## Notes
Digital native does not mean the student understands all technology. It doesn't even mean they know most the technology. Yet that is the assumption we often make. 

Digital natives have grown up or are growing up in a world where technology is always present, but that doesn't make them a master at it. 

Previous generations grew up in an era of writing with pen and paper, but not everyone is a master of calligraphy. Most people aren't. 

Don't assume younger people "just know" how to use the technology. They  have preferences and skills, just as anyone else in anything else. A digital native may be comfortable with Apple technology, or Google, or Microsoft, or Amazon. They have a platform they are most comfortable with. They are a digital native in MacOS, but as bad with Windows as someone using it for the first time. 

The same goes for many of the teachers and administrators. People have their preferences and likes. Let them lean into that. Use the tools that most comfortable for you to complete the task. 

You can write a paper on any device. It will be the same things if you type it in Pages on iOS, Google Docs on Chrome OS, or LibreOffice on Ubuntu.
