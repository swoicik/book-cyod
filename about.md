<h2 id="the-book" style="text-align: center;">ABOUT THE BOOK</h2>

<p>This book is being written for anyone working with educational technology. If you have devices in the hands of student in your distrcit, I want to help. The book is being written from my experience as both a classroom teacher and a distrcit administrator. 

<p>The focus of the book is, how to implement an impactful and sustainable 1:1 program in a K12 environments. Not just giving every kid a device. The book will introduct and advocate the CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) model, but the ideas can be applied to any model you choose.</p>

<p>Many well intentioned and well funded technology initiatives fall flat. Programs fail for any combination of reasons; planning, implementation, culture, understanding, communication, etc. I will share what I have learned and show how to mitigate or remove these obstacles. A 1:1 program is a lot more than just the device. The actual device(s) you choose matter very little.</p>

<p>The technology used in these programs changes constantly, My focus will be on the systems you need in place to make the program work and less about specific technology. The content of the book will apply to any technology initiative you want run, not just a blip in time when (insert your favorite tech) is the current trend.</p>
