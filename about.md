I am [swoicik](https://swoicik.com), and this is my first attempt at writing a book.

I am writing this book entirely in the public (a good idea or an insane one?). You can view the progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/swoicik/cyod) or check back to this site for updates. 

If you want to contribute or support this project, please visit the [contribute page](/cyod/contribute) for ways to help. 

## The Book


## Why A Book?


## Why Public? 


## Background
I have been working with educational technology since my first student worker job at Fordham University. A professor was kind enough to hire me to work in a grant program providing technology and credit recovery resources to high school students in the Bronx. My first full time job in education was also part of this grant. Since then, I've worked in multiple public school systems, a library consortium, and consulted or collaborated on many education projects.

Outside of education, I co-founded [Rivik Media](https://rivikmedia.com) and have worked as a technology consultant for small businesses. Technology has always been a part of what I do.
