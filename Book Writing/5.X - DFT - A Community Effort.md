# 5.X - A Community Effort

One Sentence

Notes
A successful 1-1 program can’t be done or managed by just the technology department. It takes a village. 

You can’t control everything. You’re going to be expanding your technology use exponentially and your man power is staying the same. You need to give up some control. If you go into a 1-1 program expecting to monitor everything your students and staff do on the devices, or you are going to lock down everything so they need to go through the tech department, the program will fail. Students will choose to not use the device because they aren’t personal enough. Staff will be constantly frustrated and work around the systems you have in place.
