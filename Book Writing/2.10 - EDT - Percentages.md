# 2.10 - Percentages

Learn to think in percentages instead of dollar amounts when dealing with your district’s technology. This goes for the 1:1 program and beyond. This is a minor shift in your thinking with a big impact.

Students make up roughly 80% of the users in school districts, but don’t command 80% of the technology budget. Students are the primary technology users in the district. Make sure the budget reflects this. 

Some schools have this backwards or 50/50 at best. Large parts of the budget go to tools, devices, and software that directly impact teachers and administrators. Not technology that directly impact the students. 

When you are spending money on tools, devices, and software, make it accessible to everyone as much as possible. 

Situation do arise where software is needed that is not used by students. The district’s accounting software comes to mind. This is completely fine and expected. Just be aware of the percentage of the budget that is going to things that are not being used by the majority.
