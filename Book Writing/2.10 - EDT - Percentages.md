# 2.10 - Percentages

Learn to think in percentages instead of dollar amounts when dealing with your district’s technology. This goes for the 1:1 program and beyond. This is a minor but impactful shift in the way you think. 

Students make up 80-90% of the user population in school districts, but don’t command 80-90% of the technology budget. Students are the bulk of the technology users in the district. Make sure the budget reflects this. 

Some schools have this backwards or 50/50 at best. Large parts of the budget are going to tools, devices, and software that directly impact teachers and administrators. Not things that directly impact the students. 

When you are spending money on tools, devices, and software, make it accessible to everyone as much as possible. 

Situation do arise where software is needed that is not used by students. The district’s accounting software comes to mind. This is completely fine and expected. Just be aware of the percentage of the budget that is going to things that are not being used by the majority.
