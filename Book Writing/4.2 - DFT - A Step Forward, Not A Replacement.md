# 4.2 - A Step Forward, Not A Replacement

One Sentence

Notes
New paint on an old system. 1-1 computing allows for an opportunity to complete change the culture and learning of your district. Don’t go 1-1, but continue to print everything out. Don’t go 1-1 and continue to have a teacher centered learning experience (teacher at front of class, lecturing). 1-1 computing allows you to break away from teacher centered learning. You can truly build a 1 on 1 learning environment. The technology allows teachers to form an actual connection with students individually and on their terms. Use technology as a step forward, not a replacement.

If you are making old lesson plans digital, don’t just scan them in and have kids write on the PDF. That’s not a digital lesson. That’s replacing a $0.25 paper and pencil with a $500 digital pad and pen. That’s a waste. 

Think, “How can I make this less more interactive?” How can I make this lesson digital first? If you had to make this lesson for the first time today with the tool you have now, would it look the same?
