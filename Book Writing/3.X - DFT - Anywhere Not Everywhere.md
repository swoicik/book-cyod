# 3.X - Anywhere Not Everywhere

One Sentence

Notes
One on one not one to one 

Giving every student a device does not guarantee internet access to every student. It’s a poor assumption that everything the student does with the device in the classroom can be replicated at home. 

Students have a device that they can work from anywhere with. They shouldn’t be required to work from everywhere as a result. 

Some parents may not want the devices on in their home. Or feel obligated to let their students be on the device at home. Make it clear when a student needs a device and make that on rare occasions outside of the classroom.
