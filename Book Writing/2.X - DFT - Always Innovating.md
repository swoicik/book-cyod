# 2.X - Always Innovating

The CYOD models makes it possible to plug and play with innovation. When you have a platform that is able to accept and integrate any type of device, when a new technology is released, you just add it as an option. 

There isn't a massive shift, infrastructure upgrade, and training to be done to add a new device. 

The reason being, you are just adding a device. You are not replacing device. And you are not removing other options.
