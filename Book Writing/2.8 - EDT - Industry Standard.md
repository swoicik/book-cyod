# 2.8 - Industry Standard

What is the industry standard for educational technology? There is none. The device that a student uses in a classroom is made as a personal preference decision. Either by the student, the parent, the teacher, the administration, or some combination. No book or standard says every student should use this one device.

There are occasional guidelines depending on who you consider an expert or who you work with for vendors. There is often some agenda behind the guideline.

But, talk to 20 experts in a field and you'll get 20 unique technology set ups for how they complete their work.

There isn't an industry standard for educational technology. Every author, programmer, professional has their own set up. Their preferred hardware and software. And these preferences often change.

Don't try to find an industry standard or a one size fits all solution. It doesn't exist.

Educators don't believe there is a one size fits all solutions for anything else in education, why would the device the student uses be any different?

Personalized learning, requires personalized tools.
