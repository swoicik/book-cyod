The 1:1 program should not be based around the device. The less attention you place on the device the better. Devices change, fads change, the goal of the CYOD system is to build a 1:1 program independent of the device. 

Whatever the new device is for that school year, it would be able to just drop into your CYOD program. Having a new device from some company become popular in education shouldn't force a district to change how they operate. Yet this happens constantly. 

A number of years ago the iPad was the best tool out there for education. Many schools adopted a 1:1 iPad program. Years go by and now the Chromebook is the "best tool" for education. Many schools are stuck transitioning from iPads to Chromebooks. The IT department has to go from an entirely Apple District to being a Google District. But why was the district tied to just one company in the first place?

With a CYOD platform, you should be able to use any combination of devices from any combination of companies. The district doesn't get tied to one company or platform. The technology plan should always be to provide the best and most assigned resources to students.
