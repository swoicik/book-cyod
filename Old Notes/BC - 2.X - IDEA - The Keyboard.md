# 2.X - IDEA - The Keyboard

## One Sentence
There isn’t a right way to use a computer. And there isn’t one way. 

## Notes
This should be devices into two chapters; The Keyboard and “Real Work”


Not the only way to interact with a computer. Voice, touch, sight. 

I’ve heard this argument come up a lot in 1:1 programs. It usually goes something along the lines of... “real computing is done with a keyboard.” 

I’ve also seen it applied to software, “real work is done in Microsoft Office.”

Usually it’s followed by comparing it to another way of doing things as good for beginners, but not serious use. 

Remember when the iPad wasn’t for creating? 

Remember when Google Docs was just for quick work on the go?

Remember when talking to your computer was ridiculous? 

Remember a time when the graphical interface was considered novelty? 

There’s a “real” way to use a computer, a “real” way to interact with a computer, or a “real” piece of software. What is real is being comfortable and able to do what you need to do. 

I grew up using a computer that had a keyboard and mouse. It’s how I’m most comfortable. But now I use an iPad 90% of the time for work, and use touch typing about 50% of the time (external keyboard the other half).

My son is growing up where every computer has a touch screen and a voice assist. His first instinct with a computer isn’t to type a command, but ask it a questions. When he’s trying to find a video to watch, he doesn’t type in a search, he hits the microphone button and asks “find videos of dirt bike jumps.” When he wants to use the TV he yells “xBox on,” followed shortly by “xbox Mickey Mouse.”
