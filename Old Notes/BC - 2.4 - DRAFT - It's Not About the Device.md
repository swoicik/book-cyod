# 2.2 - It's Not About the Device

## One Sentence

## Notes
The 1:1 program should not be based around the device. The less attention you place on the device the better. Devices change, fads change, the goal of the CYOD system is to build a 1:1 program independent of the device.

Whatever the new device is for that school year, it would be able to just drop into your CYOD program. Having a new device from some company become popular in education shouldn't force a district to change how they operate. Yet this happens constantly.

A number of years ago the iPad was the best tool out there for education. Many schools adopted a 1:1 iPad program. Years go by and now the Chromebook is the "best tool" for education. Many schools are stuck transitioning from iPads to Chromebooks. The IT department has to go from an entirely Apple District to being a Google District. But why was the district tied to just one company in the first place?

With a CYOD platform, you should be able to use any combination of devices from any combination of companies. The district doesn't get tied to one company or platform. The technology plan should always be to provide the best and most assigned resources to students.

It's not about the device, so don't make it a conversation topic. CYOD removed the device from the conversation. Don't let the 1:1 program turn into a debate about iPads vs Chromebooks. It should be about making it possible for students to use the best technology resources available to them.

Don’t start with the device. In this book, I am going to refrain from recommending or using a specific device. Chromebooks, iPad, Surfacebooks, Kindles, Netbooks, have all seen their day in education. If you try to build your 1-1 program around a specific device, you’re not going to be ready in the future when things change. Have a system that is flexible and a culture that is adaptable. Whatever the new device or technology is, you should be able to just swap it into your existing system. Not have to rethink the entire program because you move from iPads to Chromebooks. 

Don’t start with the device. Many districts focus on the device first. Chromebook vs iPad vs netbook vs Surface vs Kindle vs whatever. You can find the hardware to fit your needs and budget after you have the plan and system in place.
