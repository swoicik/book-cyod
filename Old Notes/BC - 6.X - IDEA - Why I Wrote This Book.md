Why Am I Writing This Book?
First off, thank you for your interest in this book. This project didn’t originally start out as being a book, but as I did more research, learned more from experience, and wrote more things down, it became clear there was more content than expected. A book seemed the best medium to get all the information not only shared, but actionable as well.

I have worked in educational technology my entire career. My first real job in college was managing the technology in a high school credit recovery program. To day, I am a technology director for a K12 public school district. With numerous jobs in between.

Over the years, a lot has changed in educational technology and a lot stays the same. It is amazing how often the same mistakes are committed over and over again just because the technology changed. This book is an attempt to ensure mistakes don’t continue. Too much educational dollars have been wasted on poorly planned or poorly implemented technology projects.

This book will focus on systems, ideas, and ways of thinking about educational technology that will make a project successful no matter what the actual technology is.

This is my first book.

Why was it written in public.
Once the decision was made to write a book, a lot of research went into how to do this. There is plenty of advice online, but little on the actual writing process authors went through.

As part of writing this book, I wanted to share how the book was written. You can see the entire history of this book, from research, to organization, to drafts, to final product on GitHub. All versions are saved in the GitHub repository.

I hope this serves as a guide or inspiration to anyone else thinking of writing.
