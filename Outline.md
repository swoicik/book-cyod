# Book Outline

A rough draft of the outline for the book (chapters are not currently listed in order, but in the random order I throughly of them. 

Book should be separated into three main categories. Each section/chapter fitting under one of the categories. 
1. Technology
2. Students
3. Teachers 
4. Final Thoughts

## Dedication

## Introduction
Don’t start with the device. In this book, I am going to refrain from recommending or using a specific device. Chromebooks, iPad, Surfacebooks, Kindles, Netbooks, have all seen their day in education. If you try to build your 1-1 program around a specific device, you’re not going to be ready in the future when things change. Have a system that is flexible and a culture that is adaptable. Whatever the new device or technology is, you should be able to just swap it into your existing system. Not have to rethink the entire program because you move from iPads to Chromebooks. 

## It’s Not About the Device 
Don’t start with the device. Many districts focus on the device first. Chromebook vs iPad vs netbook vs Surface vs Kindle vs whatever. You can find the hardware to fit your needs and budget after you have the plan and system in place. 

## Start the Discussion Early. Include Everyone

### Include Students

### 1:1 Is For Everyone 
Teachers, administrators, and staff should be part of the 1:1 program. A platform for everyone. The same resources the students use are the resources the teacher use, are the resources the administrators use, are the resources the tech department uses. 

Include everyone in the 1-1 program, don’t single out students. It never makes sense to me in a school district, when teachers, students, and admins all run on their own system. Teachers have Mac Computers, Students have Chromebooks, and Admins have Windows. Students don’t deserve an inferior device. Let them be able to do the same thing as the teachers.

### 1:1 Does Not Equal Always On

### The Projector

### It doesn't have to scale
Don't let scalability get in the way of progress. Efficiently won't always be there at the start. It's a process. Figure out a process that works first, then work on scale and efficiency. 

Some things just need to be done by hand to get done. 

Hard work is hard. 

Example of transcribing inventory list from paper forms to Basecamp individually for collection. 

### Not a replacement for teaching or teachers 

### Systems Over Hardware 
Plan how the 1-1 program will actually work in the classroom and administratively. If you have a good system, you should be able to plug and play any hardware or software as Technology evolves and changes. 

### Culture Matters
Include the school and district community early and often. Let them know the small changes you will be making and what the overall goals is. Have a driving principle as to why you are doing things the way you are, and make it known to all parties. 

This will help people understand what you are doing, and if they have criticism or comment, they will be in the view of the overall goal you are trying to achieve or guiding principle. 

"Changing culture is hard - it's easier for leadership to believe buying a new product/technology will do it for them, but it rarely does. And when this fails, there's a new product on the horizon that makes similar promises and the loop continues. #someproblemsarenttechnological" - Scott Berkun - https://twitter.com/berkun/status/996534329302966273

### Familiar Devices 

### Accessible Software
Use software the is accessible to everyone. I mean this as a platform as well as the traditional sense. If a teacher is using a program to teach a class, make sure students have access to that same software. 

Example: A teacher does their lesson in SMART Notebook. Teachers the classs as a lecture in front of a SMART Board. AFter the class the teachers can’t share the SMART Notebook file with students, they don’t have software that can open in. If a student is absent, he can’t view the lesson from home. 

Teachers need to view their classroom as something beyond the walls. Content should be accessible from anywhere. 

A platform for everyone. If you are building a 1-1 program, make sure that teachers are on that platform as well. It frustrates me to see students on Chromebooks and teachers on MacBooks. How are they supposed to collaborate if they aren’t even using the same technology? Teachers don’t need access to software and hardware that isn’t available to students. If students are on Chromebooks with Google Apps, teachers should be using the same. 

### There Isn’t One Learning Style
Alt Title: There Isn't One Way To Learn

Asynchronous communication vs in person. Collaboration vs individual work. Presentation vs essay writing. Let students learn and demonstrating learning in a way that suits them. With a 1-1 program, students have access to the technology to produce anything they want. Don’t make them only hand in a Google Doc. Let students demonstrate learning in a way that suits their learning style. Doing a Presentation, creating a video, a song, an essay, a poem. 

Let students work outside the classroom and embrace asynchronous communication. Let students reflect and think about answers rather than putting them on the spot. Let quiet students be active online, let students that want to speak up in class continue to do so. 

There is no ideal student, and we shouldn’t put anyone into that kind of stereotype. 

Personalized learning means letting students learn and gain knowledge the best way for them. 

### Start Young (Learning How to Learn with Technology)
Once a student is in high school, most have figured out their learning style. They know what works best for them. If you want technology to take off in your school you need to start young. 

I don’t mean roll out a 1-1 program in grades PreK-5 first, but make sure these grades have access to technology. Students can’ have limited technology use in school, then be given a laptop when they get to high school and be expected to know what to do with it. They will treat it like they do a personal device, because that is all they have had. And oftentimes, they will prefer to use their personal device.

Students need to learn how to learn with technology in younger grades. This doesn’ need to be taken to an extreme. I’m not recommending out K-4th graders should be on computers all day, but they should know about computers and have experience using them as a educational tool. Not just for games and videos like they may do at home. 

### It’s Not A Fight For Control (Between Users and IT)
The more you try to control everything done on a district issues device the more disastrous the 1-1 program will be. 

Focus on educating staff and students on how to use the devices. How to be good Digital Citizens. 

Don’t try to lock down everything, allow what you can, and let mistakes be teaching moments. Students need to learn from mistakes. Even mistakes with technology. Letting those mistakes happen in a school environment where they can be fixed and learned from, is far better then it happening in the outside world. 

Giving students more control over what they do with the devices. Making them more personal. Students should be able to perform tasks they perform in the real world. Not just things allowed or installed by Administrators. Let students install Apps.

### Use Technology As A Step Forward, Not A Replacement
Alt Title: A Step Forward, Not Sideways
Alt Title: Use Technology As A Step Forward, Not A Replacement

New paint on an old system. 1-1 computing allows for an opportunity to complete change the culture and learning of your district. Don’t go 1-1, but continue to print everything out. Don’t go 1-1 and continue to have a teacher centered learning experience (teacher at front of class, lecturing). 1-1 computing allows you to break away from teacher centered learning. You can truly build a 1 on 1 learning environment. The technology allows teachers to form an actual connection with students individually and on their terms. Use technology as a step forward, not a replacement.

### It’s A Community Effort
A successful 1-1 program can’t be done or managed by just the technology department. It takes a village. 

You can’t control everything. You’re going to be expanding your technology use exponentially and your man power is staying the same. You need to give up some control. If you go into a 1-1 program expecting to monitor everything your students and staff do on the devices, or you are going to lock down everything so they need to go through the tech department, the program will fail. Students will choose to not use the device because they aren’t personal enough. Staff will be constantly frustrated and work around the systems you have in place.

### Digital Citizenship 

### Student At Home
Consider the environment of your students and staff outside of school. Do they have internet? Do they have a safe environment for the technology? 

Share story about student who was afraid to bring technology home. Provide options for multiple use cases. Keep technology at the school. Make accommodations and recommendation for doing work outside of school. Make staff and teachers aware what each students situation is. Don't assign homework that required internet access to students that can't easily access the internet.
