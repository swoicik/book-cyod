# Bargain Devices 

## One Sentence 

## Notes
Don't fall for the $100 device from last year. Pay attention to software updates. 

The refresh cycle

End of life updates

You get what you pay for. 

Giving every student a $100 device is an appealing offer. Itâ€™s far better to give 1/4 you students a good device that costs $400. 

## Content 
While on the topic of device, a quick note about bargain devices. 

These are the last year model devices. The too good to be true priced devices. The vendor clearing out inventory devices. Be very careful when buying these devices. 

How long will the vendor or manufacturer be supporting these devices? 

What is the end of life for software updates from the operating system developer? 

How much extra does it cost to get this years model?

I often subscribe to the idea of, "you get what you pay for." You can sometimes find great deals, but that's the exception, not the rule. 

If you have the choice of getting one grade level on 1:1 with good devices or 2 grade levels on 1:1 with OK devices, choose the good devices. You'll be better off in the long run.
