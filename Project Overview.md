## Who is this book for?

## What is this book about?
How to build a sustainable and impactful 1:1 technology plan in a school district (K12). It can be applied either by starting from scratch or adapting a current 1:1 program. 

Focus on building a plan that works, is sustainable, and will actually improve student learning. Not just replacing paper with a screen.

Bringing choice to educational technology through a blended 1-1 program (CYOD)

## Why write this book?
I have a lot of ideas about making technology more accessible in education. My ability and position allows me to help a small number or only an individual school at a time. I want the ideas and lessons to be accessible and helpful to schools and students across the country/world. Putting the ideas in writing and in an accessible format gives access for other people to implement and improve these ideas.
