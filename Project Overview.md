# Project Overview
A general overview of what this project and book will be about. To act as a guideline going forward. 

## Working Title
Personalized Learning, Personalized Technology

## Who is this book for?
The book is geared towards people running a 1:1 program in their schools. Technology Directors and Technology Staff. Administrators of teachers could also benefit from understanding the concepts in this book. 

The book should be approachable enough to not require an in-depth technology background to understand. Talking more about concepts and best practices, rather than actual code and software used. 

## What is this book about?
How to build a sustainable and impactful 1:1 technology plan in a school district (K12). It can be applied either by starting from scratch or adapting a current 1:1 program. 

Focus on building a plan that works, is sustainable, and will actually improve student learning. Not just replacing paper with a screen.

Bringing choice to educational technology through a blended 1-1 program (CYOD)

## Why write this book?
I have a lot of ideas about making technology more accessible in education. My ability and position allows me to help a small number or only an individual school at a time. I want the ideas and lessons to be accessible and helpful to schools and students across the country/world. Putting the ideas in writing and in an accessible format gives access for other people to implement and improve these ideas. 

## What questions will reader have after reading the book?
